## Introduction

The objective of this project is to design and implement an autonomous rover capable of navigating its environment while simultaneously performing real-time object detection. By combining low-level embedded motor control with high-level computer vision processing, this project demonstrates the integration of multiple embedded platforms to solve a complex, real-world problem. \
\
An autonomous rover built as **two parallel subsystems**:

- **Raspberry Pi 4**: real-time object detection (OpenCV DNN) + plays an associated audio clip (ELMO voiceline) when supported objects are detected.
- **TM4C123 (Tiva C LaunchPad)**: motor control + ultrasonic obstacle avoidance + OLED status display.

> The subsystems run concurrently and independently (UART was planned but not completed).

## Demo Summary (What it does)

### Raspberry Pi subsystem
- Captures frames from a USB webcam.
- Runs **YOLOv3-tiny** (final choice) for object detection.
- If a supported class is detected (ex: *bottle*, *laptop*, *backpack*), the Pi plays a matching `.wav` file.
- Audio is rate-limited to avoid spam:
  - object must be visible ≥ **1 second**
  - same object audio has a ≥ **10 second** cooldown

### TM4C subsystem
- Drives two DC motors using TB6612FNG (PWM + direction pins).
- Uses HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor to detect obstacles.
- Displays rover state on SSD1315 OLED (I2C).
- Behavior loop:
  - go forward if distance is clear
  - stop and show WAITING when blocked
  - if still blocked, perform turn-left pulses until clear
